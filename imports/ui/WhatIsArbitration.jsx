                <h1 className="text mb-3"><b>The principle</b></h1>
                <p className="text text-secondary ">
                Access to civil and commercial courts, very often long and expensive, most of the time discourages litigants. It is in this context that other alternative dispute resolution methods have emerged. Among the methods of prevention and settlement, arbitration advantageously replaces a lawsuit.

Arbitration is ideal for anyone who wants to settle a dispute quickly, economically and confidentially. It is a particularly suitable solution in the context of commercial or international disputes.

The mission of our Arbitrators is to make a final non-appealable decision which will be binding on all parties and which can be homologated in court.

Arbitration implements a procedure that is generally less restrictive than traditional courts while respecting the principle of adversarial proceedings.

                <h1><b>The stages of an arbitration</b></h1>
                <h3><b>1. Acceptance of mediation</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">Mediation is a voluntary process, all parties must agree to it. Each party can be assisted by a lawyer if they wish.</p>
                <h3><b>2. Signature of the agreement</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">To be able to start the process it will be necessary that each party signs the arbitration agreement which frames it and fixes the procedure.
Arbitration is strictly confidential
As a general rule, when signing a contract the parties include a so-called arbitration clause which provides that in the event of non-compliance with the contract the parties undertake to use arbitration before any recourse to the courts.</p>
                <h3><b>3. Payment of the costs of the arbitration</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">Our prices are clear and known in advance. Our arbitrators will do a preliminary analysis of the dispute which will determine its duration and cost. These costs are shared by half between the parties.</p>
                <h3><b>4. Choice of hearing date</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">Following the analysis of the dispute by the arbitrator and in agreement with the parties, a hearing duration is set and a common date will be chosen</p>
                <h3><b>5. Pre-hearing conference</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">Beforehand, the arbitrator will meet with the parties to set common rules of procedure, communication of documents and arguments and the conduct of the hearing.</p>
                <h3><b>6. Communication of documents and arguments</b></h3>
                <p className="text text-secondary">If the parties decide that the procedure is written, the exchange of documents and arguments is more flexible than before the courts, but remains under the control of the arbitrator.</p>
          <h3><b>7. Hearing</b></h3>
          <p className="text text-secondary">The arbitrator will listen to the parties, ensuring equal treatment and direct the proceedings.</p>
          <h3><b>8. Arbitral award</b></h3>
          <p className="text text-secondary">At the end of the hearing and often after deliberation, a sentence is rendered and is motivated in writing. In general, the parties have a period of 30 days to correct material errors and this later becomes final and enforceable between the parties.</p>
          <h3><b>9. Homologation</b></h3>
          <p className="text text-secondary">You have the option of having the arbitral award homologated by the court, at an additional cost. This procedure will allow you to enforce the agreement in the event of non-compliance with it.</p>
           <h3><b>10. Possible appeals</b></h3>
           <p className="text text-secondary mb-5">The possible remedies against an arbitration award are expressly fixed by the law of the country where it was rendered and are generally based on means relating to public order, the capacities of the parties or the impartiality of the arbitrator.</p>
